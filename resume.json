        {
          "q": "How do you ensure project deliverability?",
          "a_short": "Agile ceremonies, RAID tracking, clear RACI, and weekly exec updates to keep scope, timeline, and risks under control.",
          "a_long": "Deliverability starts with transparency and ownership: I run sprint planning, daily stand-ups, and retros; maintain a RAID log with owners, due dates, and mitigations; use RACI to clarify who does what; and publish a concise weekly update (progress, KPIs, risks, decisions needed). Combined with milestone gating and QA sign-offs, this keeps delivery predictable and on time."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you prioritize roadmaps under constraints?",
          "a_short": "MoSCoW with impact/effort and capacity planning; protect QA and analytics time; revisit priorities every sprint.",
          "a_long": "I use MoSCoW to classify scope, then apply an impact–effort–confidence score to sort work. Capacity planning and dependency mapping ensure realism. I protect QA, analytics, and compliance time boxes, and review priorities at sprint boundaries. This balances business outcomes, risk, and feasibility without burning the team."
        },
        {
          "q": "What is your approach to Agile governance?",
          "a_short": "Definition of Ready/Done, velocity tracking, visual dashboards, and decision logs to reduce churn.",
          "a_long": "I keep a clean backlog with Definition of Ready/Done, estimate collaboratively, and track velocity and carryover. Dashboards show throughput, blockers, and risk posture. A decision log records agreements and trade-offs so we do not re-debate. Retros drive incremental process improvements every sprint."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you manage risks and dependencies?",
          "a_short": "Structured RAID with owners and due dates, weekly reviews, and early escalation paths.",
          "a_long": "Each risk/dependency has a probability, impact, owner, mitigation, and date. I review RAID weekly with stakeholders, surface theme-level risks to leadership early, and set explicit escalation paths. Visualizing critical path tasks helps preempt slippage and protects go-live dates."
        },
        {
          "q": "What does a good go-live plan look like?",
          "a_short": "Cutover checklist, rollback plan, monitoring, and war-room comms for the first 24–72 hours.",
          "a_long": "A go-live plan includes readiness gates (QA, security, data checks), a time-boxed cutover with owners, a tested rollback path, and observability (alerts on errors, latency, send failures, data drift). A war-room channel coordinates response for 24–72 hours with SLAs, incident roles, and daily stability updates."
        },
        {
          "q": "What would you focus on in your first 90 days?",
          "a_short": "Audit data and journeys, stabilize tooling, ship quick wins, align a two-quarter roadmap with KPIs.",
          "a_long": "Phase 1: audit event quality, CRM config, and active journeys; map stakeholders and pain points. Phase 2: fix template debt, QA gaps, and monitoring; create a shared KPI dashboard. Phase 3: ship 1–2 high-leverage wins (onboarding, win-back), then align a two-quarter roadmap tied to north-star metrics."

          "a_short": "Map stages, align event schema, segment cohorts, define triggers/content, attach KPIs, and iterate via experiments.",
          "a_long": "I map stages (onboard → activate → engage → retain → win-back), define event and attribute schema with data teams, and build behavioral cohorts. Journeys use timely triggers and modular content blocks. Each has KPIs (activation, retention, revenue contribution) and test plans for message, cadence, channel, and audience."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you improve message performance at scale?",
          "a_short": "Behavioral triggers, send-time testing, template hygiene, frequency caps, and suppression controls.",
          "a_long": "I prefer event-based triggers over batch sends, test subject lines and timing, maintain responsive templates, and enforce frequency caps and fatigue rules. I build negative audiences (recent converters, unsub risk) and measure incremental lift to avoid vanity metrics. Governance prevents overlap and message collisions."
        },
        {
          "q": "Which KPIs do you typically own or influence?",

          "a_long": "I focus on acquisition quality to activation, retention cohorts (D1/D7/D30), CTR and conversion, DAU/WAU/MAU, NPS/CSAT, and revenue contribution. Efficiency KPIs include LTV, CAC, and ROI. I report with cohort and funnel cuts to explain not only what changed, but why."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you use attribution data in CRM?",
          "a_short": "Join AppsFlyer/Firebase source data with product events to tailor journeys and measure cohort ROI.",
          "a_long": "I combine source, campaign, and creative from AppsFlyer/Firebase with user attributes and product events. Journeys and suppressions account for source quality and stage. I track retention, LTV, and conversion by source and creative cohort to inform spend and creative strategy."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you measure true lift versus correlation?",
          "a_short": "Holdout/control groups, geo/time splits, and minimum sample sizes before reading results.",
          "a_long": "I use control/holdout and geo/time-based experiments with pre-registered hypotheses, power calculations, and fixed run windows. I avoid peeking and overlapping tests. Primary metrics are defined upfront with guardrails (unsub, spam, fatigue). Post-analysis is documented with next steps."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you prevent over-messaging and fatigue?",
          "a_short": "Global frequency caps, recency rules, priority tiers, and fatigue scoring.",
          "a_long": "I set global caps by user and channel, apply recency windows, and build a message priority framework (transactional > lifecycle > promos). Fatigue scoring suppresses users showing negative signals (unsubs, low opens, short sessions). A collision manager avoids multiple sends within short windows."
        },
        {
          "q": "How do you set up event taxonomy and naming?",
          "a_short": "Consistent verbs/nouns, required properties, and governance with linting and backfill rules.",
          "a_long": "I define a naming scheme (verb_object), required properties, and data types with examples. A linting checklist blocks non-conforming events. For legacy events, I map, backfill where feasible, and mark deprecations with dates. Versioning and owners keep taxonomy healthy."
        },
        {
          "q": "Have you led CRM implementation or migration?",
          "a_short": "Yes—taxonomy, templates, QA/staging, phased rollouts, rollback plans, and monitoring dashboards.",
          "a_long": "I’ve run implementations on Braze and MoEngage: define taxonomy, build modular templates, set staging and QA harnesses, integrate attribution and product data, and do phased rollouts with rollback. Observability (send errors, latency, data drift) ensures stability and scale."

          "a_long": "I sustained 95%+ milestone adherence using Agile governance, reduced delays ~10% with standardized intake/forecasting, scaled DAU 10% through lifecycle and product tweaks, and partnered on campaigns that achieved ~30k daily acquisitions within budget envelopes."

Programs included complex segmentation, dynamic content, rate limits, and consent enforcement, supported by QA checklists, canary launches, and 24–72h hyper-care."

          "a_short": "Weekly narrative, KPI dashboard, risk/decision register, and quarterly strategy reviews.",
          "a_long": "I send a weekly one-pager (progress, KPIs, risks, asks), maintain a living dashboard for execs, and keep a decision log. Quarterly reviews revisit north-star metrics, roadmap performance, and investment trade-offs."
        },
        {
          "q": "Do you work with data warehouses and CDPs?",
          "a_short": "Yes—Snowflake/BigQuery + reverse ETL/CDP for enrichment and profile unification.",
          "a_long": "I partner with data teams to model events and attributes in Snowflake/BigQuery, use reverse-ETL or a CDP for profile syncs and trait computation, and push curated attributes into CRM for targeting and measurement. Governance covers freshness, schema changes, and PII handling."
